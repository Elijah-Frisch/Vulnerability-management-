<br/>
<br />
While it is Initializing set up your virtual machine (I used VMware Workstation 17) which you can get from this link here (https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html) Just follow the download instructions (Dont worry they are simple and you can leave pretty much everything as the default settings):  <br/>

<br/>
<br />
After you finish installing open up VMware workstation and you should see something that looks like this:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/OEI2hge.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
After that head over to this link (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and click 'Create Windows 10 installation media':  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/EKqw0ga.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
When it finishes downloading open up the MediaCreationTool and accept the license agreement and after you accemt that select 'Create installation media' when you select that it should download a 'Windows.iso' file:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/mzE5qUA.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
After you download that head back over to the VMware application and click 'Create a New Virtual Machine' and when the wizard pops up make sure to select your 'Windows.iso' file where it says 'Installer disc image file':  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/k4k4n2k.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
Name is whatever you'd like but try to rememeber the name and after this you can leave everything else default:  <br/>

<br/>
<br />
After you finish the installation the virtual machine will automatically open. Make sure to press any key then just install windows like normal:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/Gx6vRyr.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
When you finish installing Windows on VMware go the the search bar in the bottom left of the virtual machines screen and type 'wf.msc' to open up the Windows Firewall options then disable the firewall byt clicking 'Windows Defender Firewall Properties' then set the Firewall state to 'off' on the first three tabs and make sure to click 'apply' before you exit out:  <br/>

<br/>
<br />
After that open up the command prompt by typing 'command prompt' into the search bar on the bottom left of your virtual machine and once the command prompt is open type 'ipconfig' to get your machines ipv4 address:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/WrErVH5.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
When you get your ipv4 address go back to your real computer and Nessus essentials should be finished initializing and you should be on a page that has an option to login using the credentials you created earlier:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/R0qqVcK.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
After you loging you should be at a page kinda like mine(your's wont have a scan already in place) from there click 'New Scan':  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/643zeWv.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
after you click that click 'Basic Network Scan':  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/Vb6tVN7.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
After you click that you will be at a page like this:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/Zevw9XZ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
Give your scan a name and type the ipv4 address from your virtual machine into where it says 'Targets':  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/Zevw9XZ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
After you name it and give it a target head over to the 'Credentials' tab and select 'Windows' after you select that type in the windows credentials of your virtual machine and after you type those click 'save' and go back to the scans:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/DXyARIp.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
After you head back to the scans you will have something on your screen where there was nothing before. Click the play button that is next to the X to start the scan and after you start it just wait for it to finish:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/643zeWv.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
When your first scan finishes if you click on it and view the vulnurabilities you might have something like this:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/TmeCiQ5.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/>
<br />
From there on just clik on all of the vulnurabilities and remediate them with whatever the instructions from nessus are and after you remediate them it should look something like this:  <br/>
